# Chaos-Game
Chaos Game is a random algorithm that generates fractals. This webpage implements this algorithm. I implemented what so called the restricted version of Chaos Game. It produces more fractals by adding constrains to the game. 
# Compatability

The webage is inteded to run on desktop devices or laptops as the desgin is not responsive to fit for tablets and mobile devices.

# How to run

You only need to clone the webpage and run index.html by your browser.

# Example Fractals
These are **SOME** of the fractals produced by the algorithm
